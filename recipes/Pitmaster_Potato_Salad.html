  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This potato salad is dedicated to everyone who somehow,someway manages to burn something while barbecuing. Whether it’s turning a perfectly cooked rack of ribs jet black while trying to “caramelize” the BBQ sauce, or starting the burger buns on fire because you heard Chef John say they’re better lightly toasted, if there are hot coals around, these poor souls will find a way to incinerate something. Well, this time we’re doing it on purpose.</p>
  <p>You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Potatoes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1/4 pounds large Yukon gold potatoes</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Dressings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Salad</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup diced red onion</li>
    <li>1/4 cup diced celery</li>
    <li>1/4 cup diced dill pickles</li>
    <li>1/4 cup diced roasted sweet red peppers</li>
    <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced chives or green onion</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Nest potatoes directly in hot coals in a charcoal grill. Surround potatoes with coals for even roasting. Roast until charred, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn potatoes and continue to roast until deeply charred outside and tender inside, 6 to 7 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Remove potatoes to a bowl, cover with foil, and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight.</li>
    <li>Combine Dijon mustard, cider vinegar, rice wine vinegar, vegetable oil, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl for the dressing and whisk thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Scrape, peel, or cut off any fully charred surface of potato, leaving some dark brown bits for a deeper flavor. Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch size pieces.</li>
    <li>Add potatoes to dressing, along with red onion, celery, dill pickles, and red peppers. Toss well with a spatula until evenly mixed. Cover; refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, or up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Add chives, mix well, and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.</li>
  </ol>
